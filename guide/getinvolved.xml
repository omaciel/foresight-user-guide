	<sect1 id="bugs">
	<title>Report and triage bugs</title>
	
	<para>Foresight Linux uses <guilabel>JIRA</guilabel> for issue and bug tracking. <ulink url="http://issues.foresightlinux.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa" type="http">JIRA is available here</ulink>, and to report or triage bugs please create an account.
	</para>
	
	<para>To report an issue, use the search box in the upper right hand corner and search for the package to make sure a bug report hasn't already been created. If a bug hasn't been created, click <guilabel>Create New Issue</guilabel> under the Foresight logo on the upper left. Fill in the summary, assign a priority, and include as much information as possible. You will receive an email once you create the bug, and when a user or developer comments or fixes the bug, you will also receive an email confirmation.

	<sect1 id="security">
	<title>Join the Security Team</title>
	
	<para>A goal of Foresight Linux is to be up to date with the latest software and give our users a secure computing experience. Join the security team to help package the latest software, test it, and write security notices to keep Foresight secure. Join the #foresight-security channel on Freenode IRC to learn more.
	</para>	
	
	</sect1>
	
<!-- ============= Developer ============================== -->

	<sect1 id="developer">
	<title>Becoming a developer</title>
	
	<para>Foresight Linux is always grateful to accept help. To learn more about packaging using Conary and rPath tools <ulink url="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/DEV/Foresight+Linux+Development" type="http">visit the Developer Wiki</ulink>. The Developer Wiki contains howto's on getting started with Conary, including recipe examples, how to switch an installation to the development version, and guidelines for submitting packages.
	</para>	
	
	<para>It is recommended that new developers submit patches to current bugs and packages before new packages. Developers new to packaging can create their own repository on <ulink url="http://www.rpath.com/rbuilder/" type="http">rBuilder</ulink> as well, and commit packages to their personal repository and the QA team will test them for compatibility.  Commit access is only given after a developer has shown a demonstrated and sustained level of involvement.
