TODO

* Fill these section with real content! (Copy-and-paste from respective pages
  in the 'guide' dir).
# high priority
  + Post Installation Configuration
    - Video Card Binary Drivers # this needs some re-thinking, (e.g. DRM has
      been enabled for ATI)
  + Getting Help - Mailing Lists

# low priority
  + Adding and Removing Software
   - Installing software from other rBuilder repositories
   - Compiling custom software and installing development tools
   - No need to have "Updating with Package Kit" and "Updating via the command
     line". The post-install chapter already talks about updating.
  + Getting Involved
    - Join the Security Team
    - Becoming a developer

* Some sections are lacking overview.
* The order of 'burning an image' and 'downloading' seems to be wrong.
  + Conary Overview: maybe want a rewrite about the features of conary
* Check whether the description in 'WiFi and Wireless' still applies.
* Add note about checking sha1sum
