    <title>Report and triage bugs</title>
    <p>
        Foresight Linux uses <app>FITS</app>, Foresight Issue Tracking System,
        for issue and bug tracking. <link
        href="http://issues.foresightlinux.org"
        >FITS is available here</link>, and to report or triage
        bugs please create an account.
    </p>
    <steps>
        <item>
            <p>The first time you visit the FITS homepage, on the right hand of the page is the Login / Sign Up section.  Click on "Signup for an account". </p>
        </item>
        <item>
            <p>Choose a Username and Password, and enter your name and email address and click sign up.</p>

    <p>
        To report an issue, use the search box in the upper right hand corner
        and search for the package to make sure a bug report hasn't already
        been created. If a bug hasn't been created, click <gui>Create New
        Issue</gui> under the Foresight logo on the upper left. Fill in
        the summary, assign a priority, and include as much information as
        possible. You will receive an email once you create the bug, and when a
        user or developer comments or fixes the bug, you will also receive an
        email notification.
    </p>
