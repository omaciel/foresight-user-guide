    <title>Tomboy Notes</title>

    <p>Tomboy is a simple, but powerful note taking application for the GNOME desktop. Tomboy makes it easy to create lists, make notes, and link it all together.</p>

    <p>To start using Tomboy, click on the yellow notepad and pencil icon in the upper right hand corner of your panel, and click Create New Note.   The first line, in larger font, is the name of your new note.  Edit this line to name your note, and then all text you enter on the lines below that will be your note.</p>
